Democracy in developed and developing countries today was birthed as a result of embracing party systems in politics and Nigeria has chosen democracy as her political administrative principle.


Elections in Nigeria are forms of choosing representatives to the Federal Government of Nigeria and the various states in the fourth republic of Nigeria. Elections in Nigeria started in 1959 with different political parties. It's a method of choosing leaders where the citizens have the right to vote and to be voted for.
Nigerians elect on the federal level a head of state (the President of Nigeria) and a legislature (the National Assembly). The president is elected by the people. Nigeria has a multi-party system (currently, there are 18 registered parties), with two or three strong political parties. However, members of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) had controlled the presidency since elections were resumed in 1999 until 2015 when Muhammadu Buhari of All Progressives Congress(APC) won the presidential election and was re-elected in 2019.
